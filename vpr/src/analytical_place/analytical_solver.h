 * @brief An Analytical Solver which tries to minimize the quadratic HPWL
 *        objective:
 *              SUM((xmax - xmin)^2 + (ymax - ymin)^2) over all nets.
 *
 * This is implemented using a hybrid approach, which uses both the Clique and
 * Star net models. Since circuits are hypernets, a single net may connect more
 * than just two blocks. The Clique model creates a clique connection between
 * all blocks in the net (each block connects to each other block exactly once).
 * The Star model creates a "fake". moveable star node which all blocks in the
 * net connect to (but the blocks in the net do not connect to each other).
 *
 * The Star net model creates an extra variable for the solver to solve; however
 * it allows the matrix to become more sparse (compared to the Clique net model).
 * This solver uses a net pin threshold, where if the the number of pins in a
 * net is larger than that threshold, that net will use the Star net model, and
 * if the number of pins is smaller the Clique model is used.
 *
 * This technique was proposed in FastPlace, where they proved that, if the
 * weights of the Star and Clique connections are set to certain values, they
 * will both achieve the same answer (minimizing the quadratic HPWL objective).
